Client side - customer app 


Switch - Takes your location

It pings server - with that location - server returns the nearest 10 drivers (radius later) â€” whether locus or lat/long or something else


User selects a driver - driver gets a notification? or we schedule it? - regardless, server pings back with a confirmation boolean variable - user gets a confirmation screen - with all details  - go back to home screen


Once its confirmed - customer can view his pending rides - he can book multiple rides - 

Ride will start when driver clicks ride started - Once a ride is going on - Current ride time and cost ?





Driver tables:

Details - Profile, rating, 

Current Status - Location, 

Past rides - history, 


Master Drivers table: 

All drivers, their location, current status - server looks up 10 nearest - returns to the customer app with JSON object array (of driver details - location, profile, ratings, contact details, etc)
