Business Summary - Driverr provides an on demand chauffeur, driver or valet service for customers who want to use 
their own car. Driverr allows the user (customer) to discover drivers near them based on a real time location 
discovery service. They can view a detailed profile of the driver's past drives inclduing customer feedback, and then 
book someone they feel would best suit their car and preferences. 




Team Members - Hari Krishnan (current designation), Shivalik Sen (Software Developer at Codigami Labs), Hardik Shah(current designation)


Customer pain point and solution - Currently the only way to book a driver or chauffeur for a customer, is to get an
agent's number, call them up and ask for a driver. Customers are at the mercy of these agents to send them a reliable driver
and it often takes very long for the driver to reach the customer, as this model is not location efficient. Further

Business Model - ?



Market Size - The size of the private transportation sector in India is huge (last year there were 1.87 million sales in India) and the number grows at 5% per year. A decade ago one car per family was the norm, now it is two-three. 


Revenue Model - Transactions through app, as in Ola model. Drivers get majority of the share of the ride fare. Agents get a percentage of the remaining, if driver signed up through an agent. Rest of the fare is our revenue. Typical rates can start from: Rs. 99/hr during the day and Rs. 199/hr during the night. 


Competitiors - There is one online competitor in our exact segment, DriveU , based out of Bangalore. They just launched with 50 drivers only. Offline, there are innumerable agencies which are listed on Just Dial and other listing sources, but since we plan to utilise these agencies, they are not competitors but synergising resources for us.

What are we about? Who are my customers? What sustained difference do we bring about in their lives? 

Assumptions questioned: Will agents push it to customers? Will they give the customer database? How bad will the customer conversion rates be? How about drivers/agents incentivised per customer signing up? Value Prop to the AGENT?! 

Will the agent make more money? Is that quantifiable? 

Drivers will have android phone? 

How tech savvy are the driver class people actually? 



*Trip time start and end only - just a timer

Raja Kaku’s points:


Value added services - 

Partnership with Indian Oil/Hindustan Petroleum - loyalty points for drivers - similar to what office secretaries do while booking rooms for bosses - have a Driverr card which will pay for fuel/rooms/food/tolls

Look at creating a gateway for drivers - for value added services like RTO, insurance, servicing, driving teaching

Look at HCV’s - gadgey patil , trucking companies

Look at tying up with Navi Mumbai Wholesale Market - driver supplying - sign an MOU 

Till 18 months - granular plan - target markets, cities, - marketing - entire ecosystem - make the driver the centre of all the action - think of everything and everybody else around the driver - 

Look at MOUs with BlaBlaCars, etc - even a positive reaction will do - Ola, Uber, etc

Show the strong tech background in the plan - for future proof tech which is solution agnostic


0-6 months - few agents and few B2b

6-18 - all VAS

18-36 - geographical penetration

36-72 - gateway/card, technical solutions and PAAS


Look at one investor from the transport sector 

Insurance + Oil + Loans + other VAS - major income 

Think of the driver not as the end point - but as the starting point - the driver can take the car to many places 

The guy who needs a driver can be passengers, truck owners, taxi fleet owners,  - segments: HCVs, LCVs, all other segments

India is a logistics hungry country - drivers needed for ALL LOGISTICS

Client side - customer app 


Switch - Takes your location

It pings server - with that location - server returns the nearest 10 drivers (radius later) — whether locus or lat/long or something else



Driver tables:

Details - Profile, rating, 

Current Status - Location, 

Past rides - history, 


Master Drivers table: 

All drivers, their location, current status - server looks up 10 nearest - returns to the customer app with JSON object array (of driver details - location, profile, ratings, contact details, etc)


User selects a driver - driver gets a notification? or we schedule it? - regardless, server pings back with a confirmation boolean variable - user gets a confirmation screen - with all details  - go back to home screen

Ride Later - Manually handle - take an order and send confirmation message and call him up 

One way trip check - checkbox on driver app?

Coupon code - on customer app (simple text box with validation)


Initially customers will prefer phone calls for confirmation!!



Once its confirmed - customer can view his pending rides - he can book multiple rides - 

Ride will start when driver clicks ride started - Once a ride is going on - Current ride time and cost ?









10 + (10-15) + (10-15) + (15-20) + (40-50) + (5-10)




——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

12-19th: Sign up 2 agents, 20 drivers - first 20 rides over the 17th weekend
20th - 27th: Sign up 2 more agents, 20 more drivers - next 50-80 rides
